## Introduction

Devil Fruits have always granted incredible superhuman abilities to those lucky or unlucky enough to consume one. However, the few examples we have seen of Devil Fruits achieving an "awakened" state seem to dramatically amplify a user's already extraordinary powers to near godly levels. The process of how one awakens their Devil Fruit is still shrouded in mystery within the One Piece universe. This blog post aims to theorize and speculate on the types of abilities that some of the most prominent Devil Fruits seen so far may exhibit if their users were to reach the awakened state.

### The Gomu Gomu no Mi's Boundless Elasticity  

Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Mi allows him to stretch, bounce and morph his body like rubber. In an awakened state, Luffy may gain the ability to apply his rubber-like properties to his surroundings. He could turn the ground or structures elastic, allowing him to bounce even higher or stretch great distances. Luffy may also gain much finer control over his limbs, joints and body, generating rubber projectiles from his fingers or limbs with perfect precision. His Gears may become even more powerful and dangerous with awakened Haki enhancement.

### Igniting Infernos from the Mera Mera no Mi

Ace's Mera Mera no Mi lets him generate and control fire. If awakened, Ace theoretically could ignite anything flammable within an enormous radius. He may gain the ability to induce and manipulate widespread raging infernos and explosions at will. Ace would likely become immune to all forms of heat and fire within the aura of his awakened Devil Fruit. Entire areas could instantly be engulfed in firestorms under Ace's command. 

### Transforming Reality with the Hito Hito no Mi 

Sengoku's Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Buddha grants him immense strength and the ability to transform parts of his body into gold. In an awakened state, Sengoku could transform inanimate objects or even living things into golden likenesses of Buddha. He may even gain the power summon and command legendary Buddhist figures, spirits and artifacts. His touch or presence alone could imbue allies with enhanced physical capacities and wisdom on the level of celestial beings.

### Cellular Manipulation of the Ope Ope no Mi

The Ope Ope no Mi in Law's possession allows him vast surgical techniques and the power of "Room" to rearrange space. An awakened Law may gain the supernatural ability to apply his "OP-OP powers" remotely without even generating his "Room." He could disassemble and reconstruct targets and locations from a distance. Law could instantly transport people and objects across any distance through dimensional manipulations. Most frightening of all, Law may achieve cellular and molecular level control over victims' bodies and physiology.

## Shaping Terrain with the Mochi Mochi no Mi

Katakuri's Mochi Mochi no Mi grants him such advanced Observational Haki that he can see slightly into the future. In an awakened state, Katakuri likely could transform the terrain and structures around him into vast, elastic mochi fields that he could fully manipulate. Much like Luffy discussed earlier, Katakuri would gain the ability to generate mochi projectiles with perfect precision and on an enormously magnified scale. His future sight may extend across transformed mochi areas, allowing him awareness of everything and everyone within that space. Katakuri's mochi fields may additionally convey enhanced physical properties to allies and grant invisibility or phasing abilities to pass through objects like a logia.

## Absorbing Properties Through Darkness

Blackbeard's Yami Yami no Mi bestows its user with the ability to generate and control destructive darkness. Speculation on an awakened state centers around Blackbeard gaining definitive control over one of the most fundamental forces in the One Piece universeâ€”gravity. Blackbeard may absorb all properties of anything his darkness engulfs, allowing him to wield various Devil Fruit abilities simultaneously. Some theorists believe Blackbeard could even create microscopic or localized black holes at his whim to consume and destroy anything caught within their gravitational pull. His darkness may also function as an impenetrable defensive layer channeling all external force.

## Tsunamis and Earth-Shaking Power

As one of the most exceptionally rare and powerful Paramecia types, it's no surprise that Blackbeard later obtained the tremor-generating Gura Gura no Mi as well. When awakened, Blackbeard could channel its already colossal power to induce massive tsunamis and earthquakes across entire oceans and lands at will. He may even focus the Gura Gura no Mi's power into immensely destructive localized shockwaves and vibrations resembling bursts of pure force. As an insulated safeguard, Blackbeard could create spherical barriers of intensely dense vibrational energy to withstand any onslaught against himself. No Navy or Pirate force could hope to damage an awakened Blackbeard with both his Fruits fully mastered.

## Conclusion 

The glimpses we've seen of awakened Devil Fruits hint that their users gain a form of reality warping or supernatural mastery over conceptual forces themselves. While still just speculation, awakening some of the most prominent Paramecia and Logia types could grant powers rivaling legitimate gods or natural disasters. It's exciting to imagine the new heights characters like Luffy may reach by awakening his abilities too. Some theorize that further stages of awakening could involve manipulating time, space, dimensions, souls or even rewriting reality itself. Only more reveals from Oda can shed light on the endless possibilities for awakened Devil Fruits in One Piece.
