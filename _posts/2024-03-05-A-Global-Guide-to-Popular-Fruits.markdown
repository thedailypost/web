## India's King of Fruits - Mango

Mango has a long history of popularity in India and is considered the countryâ€™s national fruit. Alphonso, Kesar, and Dasheri are some of the most popular mango varieties grown in India due to their excellent flavor and texture. Indians enjoy mangoes in a variety of ways - as a refreshing snack on a hot summer day, blended into smoothies to beat the heat, or added to curries and other dishes to complement the flavors. The juicy tropical fruit is a favorite among people of all ages. 

## Other Popular Indian Fruits 

Bananas are another staple fruit in India that fulfill many roles. Their portable size and energizing nutrients make them a convenient snack any time of day. Indians also add bananas to smoothies for added richness and fiber or use them in cooking curries and breads. Watermelon is a refreshing treat during the hot summers thanks to its high water content. Its sweet red flesh is enjoyed on its own or in salads. Grapevines are commonly grown all over the country and grapes put to many uses beyond fresh eating. They are dried into raisins or incorporated into dishes and desserts. Papaya contains digestive enzymes and vitamin C and is a preferred breakfast fruit or blended into juices. Guavas have a unique fragrance and sweet flavor that make them a favorite lightweight snack. Their seeds are also edible and nutritious. Pomegranates packed with antioxidants are enjoyed fresh for their seeded ruby arils or made into spreads, drinks and sweets.

### Salak - Snake Skin Fruit from Indonesia   

Salak, also known as snake fruit due to its unique brown scales resembling snake skin, is popular in Indonesia. The Bali, Manonjaya and Pondoh varieties are commonly grown. Pondoh salak has a crisp, drier texture than other varieties and a nicely balanced sweet yet sour flavor profile. Its subtle acidity complements the sweetness. Salak's distinct appearance and taste make it a unique tropical experience.

## Mango - The "Bathroom Fruit"

When mangoes were first introduced to Britain in the 1700s, westerners were appalled that Indians would eat the juicy fruit outdoors due to the mess. Mango juices and pulps dripping all over bodies led to mangoes jokingly being nicknamed the "bathroom fruit". However, the tropical king continues to be one of the most beloved fruits around the world today thanks to its delicious sweetness and nutritional treasures. Its stickiness may be downplayed, in favor of focusing on the flavorful experience of biting into sun-ripened mango flesh.

## Pomelo - Asia's Citrus Giant  

Originating in Southeast Asia, pomelo is the largest member of the citrus family. It is larger and thicker-skinned than a grapefruit, with segments of firm yet succulently sweet white pulp nestled inside. Texture-wise it is quite similar to grapefruit but with a milder, sweeter flavor profile less dominated by acidity and bitterness. These subtleties have made pomelo a popular addition to Southeast Asian cuisines as well as a stand-alone snacking or salad fruit.

## Grenache - Spain's Grape Varietal Wine Star

One of Spain's most iconic grape varieties is Grenache. It is mainly grown in the warm Mediterranean regions and produces high-sugar wines characterized by soft texture and red berry flavors. Thanks to its high soluble solids content, Grenache produces very alcoholic wines if vinified dry. It is therefore commonly used to produce fortified wines by halting fermentation with a neutral grape spirit. Examples are Spanish red vermouths and Italian Chinato. Beyond Spain, Grenache vineyards can be found in France, Australia, California and more with worldwide popularity.

### Rose Apple - Not a Rose or Apple

Native to Southeast Asia, the rose apple resembles a type of apple at first glance but is neither rose nor true apple. It is actually more closely related to guavas. Unlike guavas which have a single large seed cavity, rose apples have multiple smaller seeds dispersed throughout fleshy cavities. Their texture is juicier and less stringy than guavas too. Beyond fresh eating, Southeast Asians enjoy rose apples pickled or in desserts like jams. Their mild sweet-tart flavor combining guava and apple notes makes rose apples a unique tropical experience.

## Safety First - Identify All Plants Before Eating

When venturing into exploring new edible plants, it is important to exercise caution and ensure proper identification. Even closely resembling species can have very different effects if consumed. Unless one has extensive expertise in plant identification, it is best to seek guidance from local experts, guides or materials when identifying wild plants to be certain they are safe to eat. Better to be overly cautious than to endanger health by consuming anything unverified.

## Top 10 Fruits of India

Undoubtedly topping the list are mangoes, considered the king of fruits. Other superstars include bananas for snacking and cooking versatility, watermelon for refreshment, grapes that can be enjoyed fresh or dried, and papayas which are nutrient-dense. Regional favorites making the top 10 are guavas for their unique flavor profile, pomegranates valued for antioxidants, and local specialties worth discovering like jackfruit. India is truly a trove of luscious fruits and produces several globally cherished varieties.
