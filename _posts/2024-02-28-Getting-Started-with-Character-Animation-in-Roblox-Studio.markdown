## Introduction to Character Animation

Animation brings games to life by making characters and objects move in a realistic and compelling way. In Roblox Studio, animating your characters allows players to interact with the virtual world in a more immersive manner. This tutorial will introduce the basics of animating character rigs and provide examples to get started animating your own.

### Understanding the Animation Process

Character animation involves setting keyframes that define the position and movement of each part of the character rig over time. When played back, the animation software interpolates between these position keys to smoothly transition the character from one pose to the next. Roblox Studio allows animators to import rigged character models, select body parts for positioning, adjust timing between poses, and preview animations. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have the foundational skills to start bringing your characters to life.

## Setting Up Your Rig Character

To animate a character in Roblox Studio, you'll first need to import a rigged character model that has been designed for animation. Roblox's asset library contains many high quality rigs ready to use, or you can create your own using third party 3D modeling tools. Once imported, select the character model in the Explorer pane and click Animator to open the animation controls. Here you can see all the individual parts that make up the rig hierarchy and position them over time.

### Selecting Body Parts for Animation  

The first step is to isolate which parts of the rig you want to animate, such as the arms, legs, torso or head. To do this, either click the expand arrows next to each part name, or use the "Visibility" toggle to show/hide sections. Hide unnecessary parts to simplify the view. Now you're ready to start keying the positions of visible parts.

## Positioning Your First Keyframes

To create an animation, set initial pose or "rest" keyframes before adjusting any positions. Select the part you want to move, such as the right leg, then click the "Record" button to activate keyframing mode. Now with the Playhead at frame 0, position the selected part as desired and click "Record" again to save the keyframe. 

### Adjusting Positions and Timing

Continue positioning parts throughout the Playhead timeline. For a walk cycle, space leg positions evenly over a number of frames to achieve smooth realistic motion. You can also slip keyframes left/right to adjust timing between poses. Watch how your initial movement starts to take shape as keyframes are added. Take your time getting the posing just right before moving to the next section.

## Completing the Movement Animation 

Now that the basic movement poses are blocked out with keyframes, it's time to refine the animation. Select all leg part keyframes by dragging a selection box over them. Then adjust the positions iteratively, a little at a time, to smooth out the motion over multiple frames. Pay close attention to things like weight transfer between steps and knee/hip joint movement.

### Adding Secondary Motions

For realism, secondary motions can be added to other parts. Animate the arms swinging opposite to each leg to create counterbalance. Slight upper body rotations may also occur with each step. Don't over animate - focus on the main body language first before complicating secondary details. With practice, motions will appear increasingly natural. 

## Playing Your Animation

To preview your work, click the play button in the timeline header to play your animation back in the 3D viewport. Watch for any issues like uneven timing, clipping body parts, or unnatural poses. Tweak keyframes further to improve realism. You can also save your animation at this stage for use on other characters with identical skeleton rigs.

### Previewing in Other Tools

Animations can also be reviewed from other angles using Roblox's "Test" feature. This plays the game simulation to ensure character motions integrate correctly within environments. Issues like bad collisions or interactions may only appear at runtime. The Animation Editor also allows post-process tweaks like smoothing keyframe interpolations for fluidity.

## Advanced Animation Techniques

As skills develop, try animating detailed action sequences with incorporation of the following techniques:

### Animation Curves
Adjusting curve shapes between keys allows more control over acceleration/deceleration between poses. Curves are especially useful for secondary motion smoothing.

### Layering Animations
Multiple animations can play simultaneously on a character using additive or state-based layering rules. This allows complex behaviors like walking that turns into a run.

### IK/FK Switching
Characters often use inverse kinematics for feet planting and forward kinematics for upper body control. Learn to switch between the two pose modes for realistic motions.

### Live Animation Recording
For cutscene-like cinematics, the Live Animation plugin enables recording and skinning animation directly from motion capture devices in real-time. Try animating face expressions and full body movements this way.

## Common Character Animations

Practice the following animation essentials to create behaviors for your game characters:

### Walk Cycle
Space out evenly-timed stepped poses over multiple loops to achieve realistic balanced walking motion.

### Run Cycle  
Exaggerate motions from walk cycle with longer quicker strides and more pronounced secondary motion in torso and arms.

### Jumping
Animate squatting down then popping up with airtime between landing. Use smooth in-betweens and secondary arm swinging to sell height and forward momentum.  

### Idle Poses
Mix static poses with slight torso shifts and secondary motions to make characters feel animate when stationary. Transitions between idle poses keep things interesting.

## Next Steps and Resources

The best way to improve is through continuous practice. Experiment animating other complex actions or combing techniques, like a character throwing a punch. As skills advance, try building full cutscenes. Refer to the Roblox developer forum and community sites online for help on advanced topics. Animation is a craft that takes dedication to perfect - keep at it and your game worlds will come to stunning animated life!
