## Introduction

Roblox is a popular online gaming platform where social interactions play a big role in enjoyment. As a platform geared towards younger audiences, some players can find it challenging to socialize. This guide provides tips for making friends on Roblox based on experiences of veteran players.

### Engaging Positively in Games 

Roblox offers many games that allow for interaction, such as Epic Mini Games. By playing these types of games, you can make friends. Be friendly, energetic, and get involved by speaking in the chat. Help other players who seem shy or are struggling. Acknowledge and praise others for their good plays. Avoid negative comments which could ruin the fun for others.

### Becoming a Server Leader

Take the initiative to join conversations and bring people together. Help defuse arguments and get both sides having fun again. Look out for lone players and include them in activities. Lead with positive energy and others will want to join you.

### Valuing Underdogs 

Notice quieter or less skilled players and make an effort to include them. Ask for their help with tasks to boost their confidence and involvement. Stand up for them against bullies with kind words and shift focus back to fun. Others will admire your inclusiveness and underdogs may open up more.  

### Keeping Chats Friendly

Set the friendly tone in chats with greetings, praise and jokes. Change topics if conversations turn negative to keep things fun. Address issues kindly but do not engage with mean players or dwell on negativity. People will want to join in your fun chats and make friends there.

### Sending Friend Requests

Regularly clean your friend list to make room and keep it selective. Tell new friends your name so they can join your games. Friend people you've chatted with positively after a few interactions. Follow players you enjoyed playing with so you can join their games too.  

### Taking Breaks

Playing very actively for long periods can cause enthusiasm to drop. Step away and do other activities to recharge and prevent boredom. Return refreshed and ready to continue making new friends.

### Maintaining Friendships

Remember names and details shared in past chats. Continue including new friends when playing together. Send friend requests and messages to show you value the friendships. Friends made through fun and friendliness are likely to last long-term.

## Conclusion

Following these tips can help shy or new players engage and socialize on Roblox. Building a positive social circle is key to long-term enjoyment on the platform. With practice, players may develop their own leadership style of being friendly.
