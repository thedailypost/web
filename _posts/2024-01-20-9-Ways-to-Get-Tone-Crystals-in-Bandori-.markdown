## Getting Started With Story Mode     
### Clearing Chapters
Story mode is one of the most consistent ways to earn crystals in Bandori. Each chapter cleared will reward the player with 50 stars and 1 tone crystal. While the early chapters can be cleared quickly, progression will slow down as levels increase. Make sure to clear any event stories released as they offer crystals for minimal effort.

### Progressing Your Band
As your band levels up from clearing chapters, your stats and card strength will improve. This allows tackling harder songs and masters for bigger rewards. Prioritize leveling your cards and skills to push further in story mode. The crystals add up over time for dedicated players.

## Premium Purchases Can Boost Your Crystal Supply
### Gems as an Investment   
The Premium Happy Box offers exceptional value for gem purchases in Bandori. For under $10, players receive 1000 stars, 20 crystals upfront along with 80 stars daily for 25 days. This gives over a month of steady crystal income making it worthy investment for dedicated players. The box helps top up stars and crystals allowing more shows to be played.

## limited-Time Event Exchanges
### Badges for Rewards
Many events offer crystals as badges exchange rewards. One past event allowed trading 50 event badges for 20 crystals, working out to around 10 songs worth of grinding for each crystal. While the exchange numbers vary, event shops remain a consistent secondary source. Be sure to check the shop daily for refreshed items.

## Free Live Shows - Low Chance, High Reward  
### Hoping for Luck
Tone crystals have the possibility to drop after Free Live Show clears but the rates are extremely low. Most players report getting around 10 crystals over dozens of shows. Multi Live has an even lower chance without buying the "desperation" item to boost drop rates. Still, the free option means no harm in trying your luck regularly.

## Crystals in Sticker Shop - Rare but Worth Checking
### Buy Event Goods First 
The sticker shop frequently stocks crystals for purchase but they are far from the best value. Event cards and scouting tickets offer much bigger boosts to teams for similar prices. Crystals cost hundreds or thousands of stickers each. Unless in desperate need, it's better using stickers on boosting teams through cards instead of directly buying scarce crystals. 
 
## Grind Events For Points 
### Skill Tickets Over Shadow Crystals    
Occasionally during events, the point ladder will include crystals as rewards for high point thresholds. However skill tickets are usually prioritized as they have more impact raising card stats and team strength. Reaching the higher thresholds requires dedicated grinding. Focus first onevent cards, then skill tickets before going for crystals if points allow.  

## Login Rewards - A Rare Treat
### Daily Doses of Hope    
Daily, weekly and monthly login bonuses will sometimes include a few lucky crystals. But they make up a very small portion of the reward pool. Players shouldn't rely on or expect crystals from logins. See them as a fun little bonus on top of the steady stars income.    

## Achievements Over Time   
### Goals Drive Progress
Achieving various milestones and collection goals unlocked throughout the game offers infrequent crystal prizes. From reaching certain song counts to upgrading a number of cards, these help motivate long term goals. However the crystal payouts are low considering the effort needed. View them more as perks of natural progression.
  
## Gacha - A Tiny Chance For Luck  
### Live Show Tickets First  
With an incredibly small percentage, it is theoretically possible to receive crystals from standard gacha pulls. However the odds make it practically impossible to rely on. It's far better using stars on live show ticket bundles or limited gacha featuring event cards. Only gacha as a last resort if truly desperate for crystals and out of other options. Stay determined!

In conclusion, while crystals remain one of the scarcer resources in Bandori, dedicated and strategic players have multiple steady options to slowly expand their collection over time. Proper resource management focussed on events and team strength will deliver the most crystals for your effort in the long run. Stay strong and don't lose hope - with patience crystal riches will come!
