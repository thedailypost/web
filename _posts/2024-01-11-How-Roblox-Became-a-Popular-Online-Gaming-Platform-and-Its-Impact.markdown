## Early Days of Roblox and Growth of Player Base

### A New Creative Platform Emerges

Roblox was founded in 2006 by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel as a platform for user-generated content and gameplay. Starting with a small group of early adopters, the platform allowed players to create their own 3D worlds and games using an intuitive visual scripting system. 

Within a few years, Roblox had attracted hundreds of thousands of players, particularly among younger age groups interested in creative virtual worlds. Players could customize their avatars, chat with other users and explore an ever-expanding selection of different gameplay experiences created by other players.
