## Tohru and Kyo 

Tohru Honda and Kyo Sohma have gone through quite a journey together throughout the Fruits Basket manga. From their initially antagonistic relationship to developing feelings for each other, by the end it was clear they were meant to be together. However, Kyo still felt guilt over being possessed by the cat spirit of the zodiac. To find peace and gain experience, he decided to move far away after high school graduation to work at Kazuma's dojo. Though it would be hard to be apart from Tohru, he knew this was something he needed to do for himself. Tohru supported his decision, understanding his desire to grow as a person. While they would be in a long distance relationship, their love and bond gave them strength to get through the time apart, believing in a bright future when they could reunite. 

### Moving Forward Separately While United in Heart

Despite the distance, Kyo and Tohru found ways to stay connected like writing letters. For Tohru, graduating high school and preparing to start college without Kyo by her side was an adjustment. However, she focused on her studies and spent time with her friends to stay busy. Kyo worked hard at the dojo, gradually gaining confidence in himself through martial arts. During visits home or calls, they reassured one another that the temporary separation would make their reunion all the sweeter. With the cat's curse lifted, Kyo was free to live his life how he chose. His time away set the foundation for the bright future he and Tohru would build together.

## Yuki and Machi

Throughout high school, Yuki Sohma carried the burden of expectations as the "prince" of the zodiac due to his good looks and polite demeanor. However, underneath was a lonely soul who yearned to be seen for who he truly was. Enter Machi Kuragi, a quiet classmate who didn't view Yuki through the lens of his reputation. She saw beyond surface level and understood his hidden longing for genuine companionship. Over time, Machi's presence helped Yuki realize his deep care for Tohru was more like that of a mother than a love interest. His romantic feelings laid elsewhere with Machi, the one person who could peel back the layers and appreciate Yuki's heart. In the aftermath of the curse breaking, they officially start dating, finding calm in each other's company. 

### Quiet Comfort Among the Chaos 

While past trauma still lingered for Yuki, Machi's steadfast support provided an anchor. She accepted both his darker moments and the lighthearted side he kept well-hidden. Where swarming crowds drained Yuki, Machi's solo company replenished his spirit. After the Sohma family drama came to an end, they looked forward to a simpler future together experiencing life's small pleasures. Away from prying eyes, Yuki felt free to be wholly himself without pretense. And Machi was grateful Yuki let her in, cherishing what they had built based on true understanding rather than superficial image. Their quiet romance blossomed amid the fading chaos, grounded in sincerity.

## Shigure and Akito 

On the surface, Shigure appeared carefree and jokes around. But he had meticulously guided events behind the scenes to lift the Sohma curse, motivated by his secret affection for the formerly male-identifying Akito. For years Shigure kept his love hidden, not wanting to upset the fragile Akito or disrupt the familial balance of power. It's revealed he had been Akito's confidant and sole companion through much suffering and inner turmoil related to the zodiac's curse. With its dissolution, their romance could finally come to light. Free of the curse's shackles, Akito underwent a personal transformation while also transitioning female. She and Shigure wed, starting a family together and finding peace in each other after so much pain.

### Enduring Love Beyond Surface Illusions

While Shigure hid his deeper strategic nature and feelings behind humor, Akito concealed inner vulnerability beneath tyrannical outbursts. Only they understood the full extent of what the other endured in solitude. Their bond survived lifetimes of secrets and separation because of an profound empathy and care that ran deeper than any superficial trappings could contain. Together, they worked to mend family relationships fractured by the curse's shadow while building a life as a married couple. Through light and darkness, Shigure's steady faith in Akito and vice versa reinforced their ability to withstand outer turmoil and transformations and emerge stronger on the other side in a lifestyle more truthful and healed than before.

## Arisa and Kureno

Arisa Uotani valued self-reliance after a difficult childhood, but meeting Kureno Sohma started chipping away at those walls. As one of the zodiac spirits always stationed by Akito's side, Kureno rarely ventured out into the world on his own. However, during rare trips away from the main estate, he connected with Arisa's fierce independence and spunk. Though he stopped seeing her out of fear of angering Akito, their bond never fully faded. When Kureno ended up hospitalized after the curse broke, Arisa refused to abandon him. She helped in his recovery process with tough love, and afterwards they chose a quiet life together in the countryside healing from past wounds in each other's company.

### Breaking Free of Restrictive Chains 

Both Arisa and Kureno understood what it was like to be chained down by traumatic circumstances outside their control for most of their lives. Yet underneath it all, they had a resilient spirit yearning to spread its wings. Finding one another allowed them to chip away at self-imposed walls and restrictive societal expectations piece by piece. While their relationship faced obstacles, Arisa's feisty devotion and Kureno's growing inner courage provided the strength to break free. In each other, they found safety and acceptance to simply be—with no demands except companionship as they carved out a humble path ahead pursuing warmth, recovery and liberty daily.

## Saki and Kazuma 

Saki Hanajima's ability to sense others' auras made forming close bonds challenging. Yet she admired Kazuma Sohma for his patient, calming nature—so different from those who feared her gift. After high school, Saki got a job as a home cook at Kazuma's dojo, desiring to learn more about the enigmatic man. Though their relationship remained ambiguous, subtle hints pointed to a possible romanticconnection developing as they better understood each other on a deeper nonverbal level. However, it's implied in the sequel story that while Saki found love and had a child, her son's father was not Kazuma or Japanese. Regardless of romantic outcomes, Kazuma accepted Saki exactly as she was and she cherished having someone who brought her inner peace in a turbulent world. 

### Forging Bonds Through Calm Acceptance

In a society not always welcoming of those perceived as different, Kazuma served as a stabilizing force for Saki. He soothed her anxieties not through empty promises to "fix" what couldn't be changed, but with steadfast kindness, patience and nonjudgment. Learning to feel secure in another's company took time for Saki after years of loneliness. But day by day, Kazuma's calm demeanor reassured Saki of her inherent worth exactly as she was, gifts and all. Whether romance blossomed between them or not, the comfort of his friendship left impact that would resonate in her future relationships and parenting. Accepting others and ourself completely is a lifelong journey, and Kazuma walked that path with Saki.

## Other relationships

Several other Fruits Basket characters found love of their own as everything changed post-curse. Hatsuharu and Rin, who faced much inner turmoil during their teens, started seriously dating as adults free from family burdens. Gentle giant Momiji, no longer bound by the zodiac's secret, looked forward to attending university with hopes of meeting his special someone. Hatori, loneliest of the zodiac trio, began smiling again with caring Mayuko by his side. Flamboyant Ayame dramatically professed his love for ever-patient Mine, and timid Ritsu entered therapy to manage anxiety with eventual goal of intimacy with girlfriend Mitsuru. No matter what happened going forward, these characters had regained control of their lives and the ability to experience love, growth and healing on their own terms outside restrictive curses or expectations. New beginnings awaited all who had endured so much inner and outer adversity. The future was theirs to shape as they pleased.
