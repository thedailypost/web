## Introduction
Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning was a beloved open world RPG released in 2012 that captivated many with its lore, character customization, and vibrant world to explore. Its remaster Re-Reckoning presents an opportunity to rediscover this rich game experience with enhanced visuals. Having thoroughly played the original, I’ve learned valuable lessons that can help new and returning players optimize their journeys. This guide aims to share the most impactful tips to boost progression, combat effectiveness, and general enjoyment through careful character building, combat approach, crafting specialization, and utilization of all the game has to offer.  

### Focus on Key Early Skills
Certain skills like blacksmithing, lockpicking and persuasion provide ongoing benefits and should be leveled early. Stealth and magic schools like dispelling are also very useful to invest ability points in from the start. Alchemy and sagecraft offer strong late-game perks but aren't priorities to fully max out initially. Maintain a balanced spread of stats across combat abilities, magic schools and utility talents for a well-rounded adventurer.

### Prioritize Core Damage and Survival Talents 
With an experience cap of level 80, there’s plenty of time to progress but skills are limited. Focus ability points primarily on core damage dealing and survival talents before utility options. Reserve additional points upon reaching the cap to experiment with alternate builds and playstyles.

## Side Quests and Exploration
Non-mandatory quests provide valuable experience, gold rewards and powerful items. Seek them out regularly to boost character growth at a steady pace. Thoroughly explore each newly discovered map region to uncover locked strongboxes, crafting components and more. Clearing areas fully maximizes returns on time invested.

### Analyze Enemy Types and Respond Appropriately  
Different foe types have unique vulnerabilities that elemental damage schools, crowd control spells or stealth takedowns can exploit. Kite and selectively engage enemies in large fights, prioritizing killing squishier targets first to simplify remaining ones. Utilize ranged weapons and magic from a distance when possible for safety. Know when to fall back, heal using consumables and then rejoin combat fully replenished.  

### Sell, Deconstruct, Appraise for Upgrades
Regularly sell unwanted items to free up inventory slots and gain gold. Deconstruct found gear into crafting materials as needed or to break down high level equipment no longer usable. Appraise all new weapons, armor and accessories to identify potential upgrades for equipping.

### Focus Crafting Specialization and Gather Materials
Choose professions like blacksmithing, alchemy or a hybrid focus and take the time to collect crafting components extensively while exploring. Specialized crafting coupled with intelligent shopping and farming ofvaluable drops enables generating significant income. Wealthy tradeskill and merchant characters can become economic powerhouses.

## Side Content Beyond the Main Story  
Post-completion, delving dungeons provides top tier loot and challenging enemies. The PvP arena offers engaging competitive combat replayability. New Game+ presents starting a fresh adventure with accumulated power and experience carrying over. These extras ensure the adventure never truly ends.

In conclusion, Revisiting Amalur's rich world has been a delight and I hope sharing the valuable lessons learned optimizing my original playthrough helps both new and returning players fully maximize their own journeys in the rekindled lands.
